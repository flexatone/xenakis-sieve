# xensieve

A Rust-based implementation of the Xenakis Sieve.

The Xenakis Sieve is tool for generating discrete interval patterns. Interval patterns can be expressed as integers, Booleans, or interval widths. Such interval patterns have boundless applications in creative domains: the Xenakis Sieve can be used to generate scales or mutli-octave pitch sequences, rhythms and polyrhtyhms, and used to control countless other aspects of pictorial or architectural design.

This implementation follows Ariza (2005), with significant performance and interface enhancements: https://direct.mit.edu/comj/article/29/2/40/93957/The-Xenakis-Sieve-as-Object-A-New-Model-and-a
